# React Dual Counter

This React application features dual counter functionality, allowing you to explore two different state management approaches:
- **Redux Counter:** Utilizes Redux for state management.
- **Regular Counter:** Uses `useState` for state management.

## Counter Implementations

### Regular Counter

- Click "Decrement" to decrease the counter value.

Feel free to explore and compare the two implementations to understand the differences in state management approaches.
